## Need More Help?
The billing tables store all the invoice information for patients, including:
- Patient details and bill numbers
- Individual charges (consultations, medicines, surgeries, etc.)
- Diagnoses and complications
- Doctor consultations

Once these tables are created, your billing feature will work perfectly!
